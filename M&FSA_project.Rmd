# Question 3: What do we want? (correlation analysis and hypothesis testing)
# Distinguish between male and female 
# Relevant variables: 1) gender; 2) wave (because it shows how points were given); 3) age (own, can be used to see if people of different ages score differently); 4) field_cd: code for degree background, use to identify which backgrounds have certain preferences; 5) race; 6) imprace: how important is it that person is of same race (1-10)?; 7) imprelig: importance of religion; 8) goal; 9) attr1_1, sinc1_1, intel1_1, fun1_1, amb1_1, shar1_1: these state what people look for in the same sex; 10a) attr3_1 for all 5 attributes: how do you think you score on 5 attributes (except shared interest) -> relate condifence level to what we want? can also use 10b) attr5_1 etc. and 10c) expnum; 11) career_c: gives a code for the type of career people pursue (some career typed people might be more interested in people that are ambiitous as well); 12) date: how frequently do you go on a date (1-7), can provide indication of 

# to do in session 3: 1) think of real questions you want to ask to limit the number of variables;  2) list all variables and make a subset; 3) clean the data for your own variables; 4) start analysis phase

# Comments: 
# 1. Mention that the dataset is relatively old, and from the US 

# 2: normalize the scores of the different waves to ensure everyone scored a total of 100 points.
